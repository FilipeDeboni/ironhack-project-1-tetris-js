# Tetris JS Clone

You can see the game running here: https://filipedeboni.github.io/ironhack-project-1-tetris-js/

Tetris was developed in Javascript as a requirement of the 3rd week of the Ironhack Bootcamp.
As a reference on the code and design, mainly because this project was develop on the 3rd week of course, I used as a reference: http://www.newthinktank.com/2019/06/tetris-game-design/
